# Administrative-portal-for-Learner-s-Academy
## Project' Details
This project aims to design and develop a backend administrative portal for the Learner’s Academy using Java EE technologies. I developed it as a project of phase 2 for the Become a back-end expert course.
The goal of this project is to apply servlet, jsp and JDBC concepts.

## Product Backlog:
1.	Create database and tables.
2.	Connect the database to the project.
3.	Create models classes.
4.	Create  a database utility class to retrieve data.
5.	Create login page.
6.	Create JSP files for all pages of the project.
7.	Create a servlet to get requests and send responses to the JSP files.
8.	Add cookies.
9.	Create a CSS file to format the contents.
10.	Debug and Test the project.

## Technologies and tools Used
•	Servlet: to do the business logic and works a controller for the project. 

•	JSP: to handle the presentation view.

•	SQL: to create and manage the database.

•	JDBC: to make operations on the database for the project.

•	CSS: to format the contents.

•	MySQL WorkBench: to administrate and manage the database manually.

•	Eclipse: to write and run the code.

•	Tomcat: to run and deploy servlet application.

## Core concepts used in the project. 
•	Object-Oriented: used to create and model objects for users and their credentials.

•	Databases: used to store and retrieve data.

•	Data Sources: used to define a set of properties required to identify and access the database.

•	Collections: used some collections such arraylist to store collection of data. 

•	Exception Handling: used to catch problems that arises in the code especially in I/O blocks.

•	Cookies: to store log-in data on the client browser. 


## How to run the program
•	clone project

•	Import the “database\database.sql” file to your database administration tool.

•	Go to “\src\main\webapp\META-INF\context.xml” file and open it.

•	Edit the database’ properties such as username, password and driverClassName to be suit to your database administration tool.

•	Now run program on a server.

•	To login you must enter admin for both username and password.
